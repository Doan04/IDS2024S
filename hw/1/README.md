1. Local, Distributed, and Centralized VCS
2. Distributed VCS is the best because it implements version-control without the flaws of the other 2 types like
   data loss risks, monopolized control, or difficulty for collaboration.
3. Pull updates the local repositor to match the remote repository
   Status gives you the status of the project and any changes to files and stages
   Add --all adds all modified files to the staging area
   Commit -m "latest build" commits files from the staging area to the local repository, and creates an entry in the
   commit history with the message "latest build".
   Push --all pushes all the branches of the local repository to the remote repository
