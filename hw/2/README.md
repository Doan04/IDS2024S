1.2) Fortran, lisp, ALGOL 58, Cobol, Basic, C, sh, C++, Python, Java, Fortran 90, Javascript, C#  
1.3) Fortran, lisp, ALGOL 58, Cobol - 1950  
Basic - 1960  
sh, C - 1970  
C++ - 1980  
Fortran 90, Java, Python, Javascript, C# - 1990 
2) Electronic Numerical Integrator And Computer  
3) Because computers use a binary number system, which represents integers most conveniently.  
4) The cache  
5) Hard drives  
6) A single bit  
7) Machine Language. Since it uses machine instructions, no interpreter is needed.  
8) Fortran is still in use today, since its creation in the 1950s.  
9) Assembly. Fortran, C, and C++ are all high-level third generation languages. Python, Matlab, and R are fourth generation.  
10) C appeared during the 1970s, and C++ appeared during the 1980s. Matlab was released in the late 1970s, and Python was released during the 1990s.  

11) B, a language used for system programming  
12) C with Classes.  
13) Matlab was based on Fortran. One of Python's ancestors was C.  
14) Registers.  
15) Smallest unit of memory is a bit.  
16) Register memory is a hundred times faster compared to main DRAM.  
17) RAM speed is 100ns, SSD is 100 microseconds, so around 1000 times.
18) RAM speed is 100ns, and HDD is in the milliseconds, so RAM is millions of times faster.  
19) Act as control switches for current. Combine many transistors to create logical operators and circuits, which can build microchips.  
20) Eventually transistors get so small that they cause problems to adjacent transistors and parts.  
21) Fetch, decode, and execute.  
22) If the computer with the faster CPU also has significantly slower RAM.  
23) Memory access, since CPU speed has outpaced memory access speed, creating a bottleneck a lot of the times.  
24) Dennard/MOSFET scaling is the relationship between shrinking transistor size leading to lower power consumption and higher speeds. Moore's law is the prediction of transistor count doubling every two years.  
25_1) 64 grains of rice in the last square.  
25_2) You'd need 2080.  
25_3) I'd need 0.30 pounds of rice.  
26_1) I'd need 2^63 grains of rice.  
26_2) I'd need 9.223372037 * 10^18 grains of rice.  
26_3) 1.3176245767 * 10^16 pounds.  
26_4) Around 6588 years.  
27) Turing-complete language would need memory access, loops, and conditionals.
