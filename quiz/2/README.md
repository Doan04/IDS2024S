1. Cache.  
2. To close the gap between memory-access and CPU speeds. Faster memory is closer to the CPU, but also smaller in capacity.  
3. Physical hard drives.  
4. Registers, L1 cache, L2 cache, L3 cache, DRAM, and disk.  
5. A bit.  
6. Because electrical currents controlled by a transistor can either be on or off.  
7. Less than nanoseconds.  
8. 1940s.  
9. ENIAC was built in the 1940s.  
10. A computer that needed rewiring to do new tasks.  
11. Calculators.  
12. Declarative knowledge is statements of fact. Imperative knowledge is knowledge on how to do something.  
13. 
	a. Declarative  
	b. Declarative  
	c. Imperative  
	d. Imperative  
	e. Declarative  
14. Imperative knowledge.  
15. ENIAC, Electronic Numerical Integrator and Computer.  
16. Python.  
17. Fortran.  
18. Memory, a control unit with a program counter, the arithmetic block, transistors, and the CPU.  
19. Calculators are an example of a fixed program computer.  
20. Fortran, Cobol, B, C++, Python, Java.  
21. 
	a. Assembly.  
	b. They do need to be compiled.  
22. 
	a. Fortran.  
	b. 7 decades.  
23. 
	a. Assembly.  
	b. Fortran, C, and C++ are all third generation. Matlab, Python, and R are fourth generation.  
24. C was made in the 1970s. C++ was made in the 1980s. Matlab was introduced in late 1970s. And Python was introduced in the 1990s.  
25. B is one of C's ancestors.  
26. C++ is based on C with classes.  
27. Matlab was based on Fortran, and C89 is one of Python's ancestors.  
28. Logarithm of a number is the power needed to apply to a certain base to equal that number. The log_10 of 100 is 2, since you need to raise the base 10 to the power of 2 to get 100.  
29. Value of S is (102)*33, divided by 2 = 1683. Mirror the series, add each number together to get 102 thirty-three times. Added together you get 3366, which you divide by 2 because of numbers being used twice. This gets us 1683.  
30. Magnetic tapes can last close to a hundred years if kept well. HDD's mechanical parts start breaking down after a few decades of regular use.  
31. The abacus.  
32. S = 10^5050. Multiplying exponents of the same base results in the same base with powers combined. This means that the final power is the sum of consecutive series from 1 to 100. 100 + 1 is 101, multiplied by (100 terms/2) gets us 5050. So S = 10^5050.
